RECIPE
the red sauce I have made for this pasta recipe uses red bell pepper along with tamatoes. but can be substituted with oninons
STEP 1 : Heat 1 tbsp olive oil. Saute bell peppers or oninons on a high flame just for 2 mins.
STEP 2 : To the same pan, add ripe tomatoes and saute    for 2 to 3 mins.
STEP 3 : Tomatoes must turn soft. Add red chili flakes as needed. Set this aside to cool.
STEP 4 : When cooled, add them to a blender jar.
STEP 5 : Blend to a smooth or coarse paste. We prefer smooth. Set this aside.
STEP 6 : While you make the sauce you can bring 2 litres water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt as needed.
STEP 7 : When the water comes to a boil, add penne pasta. 
STEP 8 : Drain off in a colander and rinse to remove extra starch.
STEP 9 : Take another pan on the stove with 1 tbsp oil. Add garlic and red chili flakes and saute it well.
STEP 10 : Add chopped onions.
STEP 11 : Saute until the raw smell goes away.
STEP 12 : Add the puree and salt. Mix and cook on a medium heat until the sauce thickens.
STEP 13 : Add oregano(optional). Mix well. Off the stove.
STEP 14 : Add the cooked penne pasta.
STEP 15 : Add shredded cheese and crushed pepper.(optional)
